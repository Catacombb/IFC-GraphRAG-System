# IFC GraphRAG System

A system that transforms IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files into a conversational BIM assistant using Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG).

## Project Overview

This implementation converts BIM models in IFC format into a labeled property graph database (Neo4j) and provides a natural language interface to query building information.

## Implementation Phases

1. **IFC to Graph Conversion**: Transform IFC files to labeled property graph format
2. **Graph Database Configuration**: Set up Neo4j and import the graph data
3. **Conversational Interface Setup**: Implement NeoConverse SPA for querying

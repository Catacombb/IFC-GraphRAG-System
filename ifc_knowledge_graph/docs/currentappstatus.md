# Current Application Status

This document provides a snapshot of the current status of the "IFC to Neo4j Knowledge Graph" project, based on an automated analysis of its codebase and documentation.

## Project Overview

The project aims to convert Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models into a Neo4j knowledge graph. This graph captures explicit information (entities, attributes, IFC-defined relationships) and implicit spatial/topological relationships (adjacency, containment, connectivity). The ultimate goal is to simplify complex Building Information Modeling (BIM) queries and serve as a backbone for various analyses and integrations.

The project is primarily Python-based, utilizing `IfcOpenShell` for parsing IFC files, `TopologicPy` for topological analysis, and Neo4j's Python driver for graph database integration.

## Current Status

2. **Topological Analysis**:
   - Utilizes `TopologicPy` for spatial analysis
   - Identifies and extracts implicit spatial relationships

## Core Functionality and Modules

### 1. IFC Parsing (`src/ifc_to_graph/parser/`)
*   **`IfcParser`**: Responsible for reading IFC files using `IfcOpenShell`. It extracts entities, their attributes, property sets, and relationships defined within the IFC model.
*   **`DomainEnrichment`**: Augments the parsed IFC data with domain-specific knowledge or interpretations.

### 2. Topological Analysis (`src/ifc_to_graph/topology/`)
*   **`TopologicAnalyzer`**: Leverages `TopologicPy` to analyze the geometry of IFC elements and derive implicit spatial relationships. This includes:
    *   Adjacency (e.g., which walls are next to each other)
    *   Containment (e.g., which elements are inside a specific space)
    *   Connectivity (e.g., how spaces are connected via doors)

### 3. Database Interaction (`src/ifc_to_graph/database/`)
*   **`Neo4jConnector`**: Manages the connection to the Neo4j database, handles query execution, and provides transaction management.
*   **`SchemaManager` and `schema.py`**: Define the Neo4j graph schema, including:
    *   **Node Labels**: `Project`, `Site`, `Building`, `Storey`, `Space`, `Element` (and its subtypes like `Wall`, `Window`, `Door`), `Material`, `PropertySet`, `Property`, `Type`. Topological labels like `Cell`, `Face`, `Edge`, `Vertex` are also used.
    *   **Relationship Types**: `CONTAINS`, `DEFINES`, `HAS_PROPERTY_SET`, `IS_MADE_OF`, `CONNECTED_TO`, `BOUNDED_BY`, `HOSTED_BY`. Topological relationships include `ADJACENT`, `CONTAINS_TOPOLOGICALLY`, `BOUNDS_SPACE`, `CONNECTS_SPACES`.
    *   **Properties**: Common properties like `GlobalId`, `Name`, `IFCType`, and specific properties for topological relationships (e.g., `distanceTolerance`, `contactArea`).
    *   **Constraints and Indexes**: Defined to ensure data integrity and improve query performance (e.g., `GlobalId` is unique for `Element` nodes).
*   **`IfcToGraphMapper`**: Maps the parsed IFC entities and their explicit relationships to the defined Neo4j graph structure.
*   **`TopologicToGraphMapper`**: Maps the results of the topological analysis (implicit relationships) to the Neo4j graph.
*   **`PerformanceMonitor`**: Tracks and logs the performance of database operations.

### 4. Processing Orchestration (`src/ifc_to_graph/processor.py`)

    1.  Parses the input IFC file.
    2.  Performs topological analysis.
    3.  Connects to the Neo4j database.
    4.  Uses the mappers to create nodes and relationships in the graph.
    5.  Handles batching and, optionally, parallel processing.

### 5. BIMConverse Natural Language Querying (`ifc_knowledge_graph/bimconverse/`)
*   **`BIMConverseRAG`**: Core class that interfaces with Neo4j GraphRAG to enable natural language querying:

    *   Parsing an IFC file and exploring its content (e.g., listing elements, getting project info).
    *   Converting an IFC file to a Neo4j graph, with options for clearing existing data, batch size, enabling performance monitoring, and parallel processing.

### 7. Optimization Tools (`tools/`)

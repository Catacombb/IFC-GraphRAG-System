## Current Status Summary

The project has successfully completed:
- ✅ Phase 0: Environment Setup
- ✅ Phase 1: Basic IFC Parsing and Schema Definition
- ✅ Phase 2: Topological Analysis and Enhancement
- ✅ Phase 3: Building the Knowledge Graph Pipeline
- ⏳ Phase 3.5: Issue Resolution (in progress)
- 🔜 Phase 4: BIMConverse - Graph RAG Implementation (next priority)

### Integration Test Results (May 2025)

Recent integration tests have verified the successful creation of a knowledge graph with:
- 306 nodes representing IFC elements
- 2328 relationships between these elements
- 17 distinct labels
- 26 property keys

### Known Issues

1. **Material Node Creation**: A type mismatch occurs when creating material nodes in the `create_material_node` function in `ifc_to_graph_mapper.py`. The error shows that a string is being passed where a map (dictionary) is expected. This affects material associations but doesn't prevent the core graph from being created.

### Key components now implemented:
1. IFC Parser for extracting entities, relationships, and properties from IFC files
2. Neo4j schema definition with appropriate node labels and relationship types
3. Database connector for Neo4j with transaction management and batch processing
4. Graph mapper for converting IFC entities to Neo4j nodes and relationships
5. Complete processor that coordinates the parsing and database loading operations
6. Command-line interface for executing the conversion process
7. TopologicAnalyzer class with functionality to convert IFC geometry to TopologicPy entities
8. Performance monitoring for database operations and data loading
9. Parallel processing for improved performance with multi-threading
10. Domain-specific enrichment with building system classification, material properties, performance properties, and semantic tagging
11. IFC optimization tools for reducing file sizes and improving processing speed
12. Debug testing tools with detailed error reporting

The next priorities are:
1. Fix the material node creation issue (Phase 3.5)
2. Implement BIMConverse Graph RAG system for natural language interaction with the knowledge graph (Phase 4)
